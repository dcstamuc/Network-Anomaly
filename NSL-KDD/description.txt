Datasets: 
The NSL KDD dataset can be downloaded using the following link.
http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

Code:
In the code:
kdd_train_2labels = pd.read_pickle("dataset/kdd_train_2labels.pkl")
here "dataset/kdd_train_2labels.pkl" is the path where the file resides.

In class train:
 os.makedirs("dataset/tf_dense_only_nsl_kdd/hidden layers_{}_features count_{}".format(epochs,h,f),
                    exist_ok = True)

here "dataset/tf_dense_only_nsl_kdd/hidden layers_{}_features count_{}" is the path where to make directories and save the checkpoints.

In class Hyperparameters:
Here we can set the parameters epoch, learning rate, number of features, number of hidden layers.
For the experiments we considered 
epoch = 10, 20, 40, 80 #epochs = [10]
learning_rate = 1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5  #lrs = [1e-3]
features = 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%  #feature_arr = [30, 61, 91, 122]
hidden layers = 1, 3 #hidden_layers_arr = [1, 3]
